design decisions or assumptions
Decision Title: Automate Regression Test Cases
Description: All regression test cases will be automated using a test automation framework.
Rationale:
Automation reduces the time and effort required for regression testing, allowing for faster release cycles.
Ensures higher accuracy and coverage compared to manual testing, as automated tests can be run more frequently and thoroughly.
Frees up manual testers to focus on exploratory testing and new feature testing.
Assumption Title: Users have stable internet connections
Description: The application assumes users will have reliable internet access.
Context: The app is web-based and requires internet connectivity.
